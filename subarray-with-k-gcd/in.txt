4


Example 1:
Input: nums = [9,3,1,2,6,3], k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The subarrays of nums where 3 is the greatest common divisor of all the subarray's elements are:
- [9,3,1,2,6,3]
- [9,3,1,2,6,3]
- [9,3,1,2,6,3]
- [9,3,1,2,6,3]
Example 2:
Input: nums = [4], k = 7
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no subarrays of nums where 7 is the greatest common divisor of all the subarray's elements.
